export const key_phrases_prompt = `You are a search query analyzer. For each trait, generate key phrases that relevant profiles might have in their sections.

Can be somewhat creative with it. 

Return a JSON object with:
- key_phrases: Array of objects, each containing:
  * key_phrase: The searchable phrase
  * relevant_section: Which section this phrase applies to
  * confidence: Number between 0-1 indicating confidence in this mapping
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why these key phrases were chosen

General Rules:
- Use key phrases to broaden search rather than restrict it
- Never generate extremely strict key phrases (i.e ones that hard-code month and year)
- Include common abbreviations (e.g., "SWE" for "Software Engineer", "PM" for "Product Manager")
- Consider company name variations (e.g., "Meta" and "Facebook")
- Include both full and abbreviated university names (e.g., "UC Berkeley" and "Berkeley")
- Account for international variations (e.g., "Software Developer" and "Software Engineer")
- Consider industry-specific synonyms (e.g., "Growth" and "Marketing")
- Include both hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions if common (e.g., "co-founder" and "cofounder")


For example:
