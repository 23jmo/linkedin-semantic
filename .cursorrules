# Project Plan:

LinkedIn Semantic Search

## Features

### Frontend:
Main Page:
- Simple search box 
- below there are some scrolling boxes of suggestions for the user to search
Search Page:
- Loading indicator showing text stream to indcate progress
- When done: shows the results of the profiles 
- Each profile is loaded as a profile card 
  - Clicking on the profile card will expand the card to show a brief summary of the person 

### Backend:
Semantic search on the LinkedIn users

## User Flow
1. User signs in with LinkedIn 
2. Backend indexes the user's entire LinkedIn network - user can't search until this is done  
3. I also want this to update a global database - this will be for use in future projects
4. Searching then uses semantic search to search user's personal database, not the global one 



##### Future Work
- global database search is behind a paywall
